title: "In Silico Identification and Validation of Predictive Biomarkers of Radiosensitivity in Head and Neck Cancer"
summary: "A dual bioinformatics approach was used to identify and validate cancer biomarkers. Literature-based candidates underwent in-silico profiling and TCGA-HNC validation. Separately, GEO-derived radioresistant genes in HPV-negative HNC were assessed via survival analysis using multiple tools for robustness."
